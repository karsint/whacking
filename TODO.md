List of items I'd like to tackle next:

- set fixed sweep channels by day of the week
- read existing pcapng files, count occurances of the ESSIDs, place top 256 into a block file, and pass file to hcxdumptool as an argument
- create report on local area which details % coverage of each 2.4 and 5G channel
